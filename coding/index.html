            <h4 class="home">
                1. Physics, science that deals with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of the observable universe. <br><br>
                2. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects under the action of given forces but also the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields. <br><br>
                3. Physics can, at base, be defined as the science of matter, motion, and energy. <br><br>
                4. Its laws are typically expressed with economy and precision in the language of mathematics. <br><br>
                5. Everything happens due to Physics <br><br>
                6. Mechanics is generally taken to mean the study of the motion of objects under the action of given forces. <br><br>
                7. Newtonâ€™s gravitational law states that every material particle in the universe attracts every other one with a force that acts along the line joining them and whose strength is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.
